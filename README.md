# HLA DNA Typing

Determining the types of HLA alleles that a person has, later will be applied to populations
Eventually could be used to create a reliable bank of donors/recipients

Input: HLA Allele Set in fasta format, DNA sequencing data (WGS) for a person that will be converted into fasta
Output: Set of HLA alleles present in the sample

We will start with chromosome 6 DNA sequence from the reference genome and build the algorithm using that sequence until data access is granted.
